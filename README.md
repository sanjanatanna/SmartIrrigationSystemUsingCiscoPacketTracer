# SMART IOT IRRIGATION SYSTEM 
Cisco Packet Tracer Project Documentation
## 1. Project Title
Smart IoT-Based Irrigation System Using Cisco Packet Tracer

## 2. Objective
The objective of this project is to design and simulate a smart irrigation system leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) concepts within the Cisco Packet Tracer environment. The system aims to optimize water consumption by automating irrigation based on real-time environmental parameters such as soil moisture levels and water availability.

## 3. Project Description
This simulation demonstrates an intelligent irrigation system capable of:
- Monitoring soil moisture levels to determine irrigation requirements.
- Assessing water tank levels to prevent resource depletion.
- Automating sprinkler activation/deactivation based on sensor input.
- Allowing centralized monitoring and control via a simulated smartphone interface.
- Incorporating a temperature monitoring feature for future scalability.
- Establishing communication between IoT devices and a Home Gateway for real-time data processing and automation.

The system reflects modern precision agriculture techniques and highlights the integration of networking, automation, and smart device interaction.
